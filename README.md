The framework is designed to execute UI tests in parallel across multiple browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, and is based on the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.

Features
Cross-Browser Testing: Supports Chrome and Firefox browsers.

BDD with Cucumber: Write test scenarios in Gherkin language for better readability and collaboration.


Parallel Execution: Run tests concurrently to reduce execution time.


Page Object Model: Maintainable and scalable test automation with POM design.


Data-Driven Testing: Easily manage test data using external files like Excel or JSON.


Configuration Management: Centralized configuration using properties files for better flexibility.
